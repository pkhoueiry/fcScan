Description: Used to detect combination of genomic coordinates falling within
    a user defined window size along with user defined overlap between
    identified neighboring clusters. Can be used for genomic data where the
    clusters are built on a specific chromosome or specific strand. 
    Clustering can be performed with a “greedy” option allowing thus
    the presence of additional sites within the allowed window size.
